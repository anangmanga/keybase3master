# 🧪 Pi Network Sandbox Mode

## Current Setup: Testing Mode

**Your app is currently in TESTING mode** with `sandbox: true`

This is **correct** for development and testing! ✅

---

## Understanding Sandbox vs Production

### Sandbox Mode (`sandbox: true`) 🧪

**What it means**:
- Using **Test Pi** (not real Pi)
- Payments don't cost real money
- Testing environment only
- Can test unlimited times
- Safe for development

**When to use**:
- ✅ During development
- ✅ Testing features
- ✅ User testing
- ✅ Before launch
- ✅ **NOW** (what you're doing)

**Current code**:
```javascript
await window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: true });
```

---

### Production Mode (`sandbox: false`) 🚀

**What it means**:
- Using **Real Pi** cryptocurrency
- Payments cost real money
- Live production environment
- Real transactions
- Real consequences

**When to use**:
- ✅ After thorough testing
- ✅ Official launch
- ✅ Real users
- ✅ Real money transactions
- ❌ **NOT NOW** (you're still testing)

**Code when ready**:
```javascript
await window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: false });
```

---

## 🎯 Your Current Workflow (Perfect!)

### Phase 1: Testing (NOW) ✅
```javascript
// In contexts/PiNetworkContext.js
sandbox: true  // Keep this for testing!
```

**Activities**:
- Building features
- Testing with friends
- Finding bugs
- Getting feedback
- Free testing with Test Pi

---

### Phase 2: Beta Testing (Later)
```javascript
sandbox: true  // Still testing!
```

**Activities**:
- Invite more users
- Stress testing
- Performance testing
- Still using Test Pi (free)

---

### Phase 3: Production Launch (When Ready)
```javascript
sandbox: false  // Switch to real Pi!
```

**Activities**:
- Official announcement
- Real users
- Real Pi payments
- Real money

---

## 📍 Current Status

```javascript
// contexts/PiNetworkContext.js

// Line 75: Authentication
await window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: true });
//                                              ^^^^
//                                         Keep this!

// Line 205: Payments  
window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: true });
//                                         ^^^^
//                                    Keep this!
```

**Status**: ✅ Correct for testing!

## 🧪 Testing with Sandbox

### What You Can Test:
1. ✅ Authentication flow
2. ✅ User registration
3. ✅ Creating listings
4. ✅ Chat/messages
5. ✅ Image uploads
6. ✅ Payment UI/flow
7. ✅ Everything!

### What's Different from Production:
- **Pi is free** (Test Pi, unlimited)
- **No real money** involved
- **Can reset** and start over
- **Safe to break** things

### How Users Test:
```
1. Users login with Pi Browser
2. Use Test Pi (free, unlimited)
3. Make "payments" (not real)
4. Test all features
5. Report bugs to you
6. No risk, no cost! ✅
```

## 💡 Simple Switch When Ready

### Option 1: Manual Switch (Recommended for First Time)

**When you're 100% ready for production**:

```javascript
// contexts/PiNetworkContext.js

// Change line 75:
- await window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: true });
+ await window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: false });

// Change line 205:
- window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: true });
+ window.Pi.init({ version: "2.0", sandbox: false });
```

**Then**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Switch to production Pi Network"
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys with real Pi! 🚀
```

---

### Option 2: Environment Variable (Advanced)

**For easy switching between environments**:

```javascript
// contexts/PiNetworkContext.js

// Use environment variable
const useSandbox = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PI_SANDBOX !== 'false';

await window.Pi.init({ 
  version: "2.0", 
  sandbox: useSandbox 
});
```

**Then in Vercel**:
```bash
# For testing/staging:
NEXT_PUBLIC_PI_SANDBOX=true

# For production:
NEXT_PUBLIC_PI_SANDBOX=false
```

**Benefit**: Switch without code changes!

---

## 🚨 Important Warnings

### When Using Production Mode:

⚠️ **Real Money**: Payments cost real Pi
⚠️ **Irreversible**: Can't undo real transactions
⚠️ **Legal**: May need compliance/regulations
⚠️ **Support**: Need to handle real user issues
⚠️ **Testing**: Must be DONE in sandbox first

### Never:
- ❌ Switch to production without thorough testing
- ❌ Test with production on real users
- ❌ Use production for development
- ❌ Switch back and forth frequently

---
